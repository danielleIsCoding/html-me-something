                <p>Ive been gaming since I was about 3 years old, thats right I was gaming as a baby and everyone was shocked my little three year old hands knew what they were doing. I remember the very first video game I ever played was Mario. Yeah, I'm old I know, but I have a love for gaming. 
                    Being able to go into a different world is fun and relaxing. Since then, I've always been into playing video games and even watching 
                    other gamers play as well. You would think with all this experience I would be a pro gamer, but Im no where close. I game for the fun and not for the competition, 
                    so I'm just ok and thats good enough. I play a variety of game types and cycle through different ones depending on how I feel. Right now my game of choice is Call of Duty.

                <p>
                    I tried Call of Duty for the first time in 4 years ago and I hated it. I didn't see the fun it at all. I wasn't very good and I spent most of my time being beaten by 
                    better players. After that I didn't try again until Nov 2020. I gave it a chance because I bought a new gaming system and it was the only game released
                    at the time that was optimized for the new system. To my surprise I enjoyed it and 4 months later its still number one.

                <p> I've  gotten much better and can actually have fun at this point. Here are some of the few plays deemed "best plays" . Its always cool to be recgonized when you do something cool 
                    well. I worked hard and was able to get a diamond camo on one of my weapons. You will see it here in one of the videos. I'm proud of my accomplihments and how far I've come.
                    Usually at this point in the game I get bored and start something else so that time may be coming. Until then I will continue to enjoy this game.
